strategy. On the technical front, our research pioneers a unified Verification and Validation (V&V) methodology 
designed for seamless integration into the daily coding practices of the average programmer. Acknowledging the 
intricacies of modern software development, spanning mobile applications to mission-critical systems with 
features like concurrency, parallelism, and AI integration, we extend our commitment to education. Our goal is to 
create comprehensive undergraduate and graduate courses focused on V&V for software systems. This 
educational initiative not only aims to instill proficiency in V&V practices but also endeavors to cultivate a 
positive shift in attitudes, emphasizing the pivotal role of V&V in developing robust and reliable software. In 
response to the prevalence of vulnerabilities in contemporary society, our project seamlessly integrates diverse 
V&V techniques, leveraging lightweight tools in harmony with familiar programming languages, especially 
executable assertions. By elevating seemingly simple elements like assert statements into a robust V&V 
technique, we aim to bridge existing gaps between isolated methodologies, cultivating a unified framework 
accessible to average programmers. Importantly, our approach requires no heavy mathematical knowledge or 
specialized tools. It uses executable assertions as the foundation for unifying various V&V techniques, including 
runtime checking, unit testing, and formal proof. The strategic integration of assertions and runtime checking, 
guided by static code analysis and formal proof, results in a more robust verification strategy. By strategically 
incorporating assertions and runtime checking into unit testing and formal proof processes, developers can 
establish a comprehensive and mutually reinforcing verification strategy. This integrated approach harnesses the 
strengths of each technique, ensuring a thorough and reliable means of ensuring software correctness across 
diverse scenarios.

countering racial microaggressions with inclusive behaviors in STEM settings. Through a rigorous iterative process, 
the project will generate a tool distinct from other anti-bias interventions, akin to public health messaging grounded in 
psychological theories on behavior change. The proposed STEM Educator Series on Student Interactions (SESSI) 
is a graphic series aimed at educators to model microaffirmations that substitute for microaggressions. A key feature 
of the proposed tool is its centering of students' authentic experiences. The SESSI is an innovative approach to 
reducing racial microaggressions in STEM by illustrating students' experiences and, importantly, alternative inclusive 
behaviors to be readily learned and applied by STEM educators. Quantitative and qualitative data from STEM 
students and faculty will be collected and applied across several phases of a theory-driven design process. The 
ultimate goals of the project are STEM educators' behavior change and more inclusive STEM environments that 
support aspiring Hispanic and Black scientists and engineers. Future research will test the SESSI prototype resulting 
from the proposed project in terms of its efficacy for reducing microaggressions and increasing inclusive behaviors.

Pregnant persons continue to shoulder disproportionate health burdens related to the US opioid epidemic. This 
burden is demonstrated by consistent increases in the number of documented cases of opioid-related diagnosis 
at delivery as week as elevated rates of HIV/HCV, psychiatric conditions, non-opioid substance use disorder 
(SUD), social determinants of health-related problems (e.g., food insecurity, housing instability), and neonatal 
health challenges/care demands. Postpartum return-to-use rates among individuals with OUD who achieved 
abstinence during pregnancy are as high as 59-99%. Recommended care for pregnant persons with OUD includes 
medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD, i.e., methadone or buprenorphine) combined with behavioral health 
services. Yet, current research is unclear regarding which behavioral health services are optimal for promoting 
MOUD treatment linkage and retention to reduce illicit use and subsequent overdose.
One promising approach is patient navigation (PN), an evidence-based practice for various chronic 
medical/psychosocial conditions historically delivered in health systems or clinics. PN addresses barriers to care 
common among those with OUD, including treatment access, social and/or care services utilization, and 
motivation to improve health behaviors. Our single clinic proof of concept (N=21) among pregnant persons with 
OUD resulted in improvements in illicit opioid use, SUD treatment attendance, and depression as well as high 
study engagement. Our pilot, small-scale (N=102), two health system, randomized trial showed solid signals for 
PN participants having superior outcomes for MOUD adherence, SUD treatment attendance, illicit opioid use, and 
overdose compared to Usual Care (UC). These results suggest that Medicaid programs may be optimal 
community-level partners to scale PN to serve this population. To determine PN efficacy within a Medicaid-
managed care environment, we propose a fully powered randomized trial to reduce illicit opioid use, promote 
linkage/retention to MOUD, and reduce opioid overdose.

The Afrobatrachia is a radiation of four frog families endemic to Africa that accounts for more than half of
the continent's currently described anuran species. This project will assess the diversity, evolutionary
relationships, and conservation status of the most poorly known afrobatrachians, ""Forest Treefrogs"" in the
genus Leptopelis. Although Forest Treefrogs are a ubiquitous component of the continent's amphibian
fauna, the group has not been revised since 1973 and then only with morphological data. More narrowlyfocused molecular studies have since 
clarified 
some taxonomic uncertainties and revealed additional
distinct taxa within currently recognized species, but morphological and molecular data have not yet been
paired to reconcile species-level diversity of the genus. A large-scale revision of the group is urgent
because conservation assessments are based on outdated taxonomy and many species occur in
unprotected and rapidly diminishing habitats. The project has five interconnected goals: (1) construct a
species-level phylogeny of Leptopelis to confirm its monophyly and provide context for investigating
biogeography and ecological diversification; (2) explore intraspecific molecular and phenotypic diversity of
widely distributed taxa; (3) characterize osteological variation with respect to evolutionary history and
ecology; (4) undertake a major monographic revision of Leptopelis; and (5) update IUCN Red List
assessments for all species recognized in the monograph. The PIs are well-placed to carry out this
project because of their extensive fieldwork experience and collaborations across sub-Saharan Africa,
access to thousands of vouchers and tissue samples, and taxonomic expertise. They will leverage these
assets to train a new generation of U.S. and African herpetologists. Leptopelis are the most species-rich
and geographically widespread genus of the family Arthroleptidae, and occur in a variety of climatic and
ecological regions across Africa; thus, they are an ideal candidate for expedited, integrative, and scalable
genus-level revisions within Afrobatrachia

Surface water availability is declining in many arid areas of the world. Particularly, water supply deficiencies 
influencing water flows and water quality have been reported over the past decades in the Southwestern USA. 
This region, characterized by prolonged droughts and escalating urban establishments, faces a particularly 
challenging scenario, impacting reservoir and lake levels and, consequently, sectors like agriculture that heavily 
rely on surface water.  Also, as ongoing changes in the water availability persist and these regions increase in 
water demand, limiting water for food production in expanding urban cities, improved data collection on their 
water bodies is needed. Specifically, water storage in lakes and reservoirs is of critical importance serving various 
sectors maintaining thriving human populations while building resilience against rising water scarcity. Improved 
data quality and sources for monitoring reservoir operations for these water bodies can enhance water 
management practices Also, in several southwestern states water resources cross international borders and give 
rise to frequent conflicts between countries with disparities in standards and data collection methodologies 
leading to disagreement over water availability, usage, and distribution. Thus, monitoring these water bodies' 
inflows and outflows more accurately is an opportunity to significantly improve water management practices This 
proposal aims to utilize and test the capabilities of the newly launched Surface Water and Ocean Topography 
mission (SWOT) for improving data collection and quantification of water availability in arid regions bodies and 
create transparency for water allocation shared between countries.

Abstract:
We are investigating alignment to ""like"" in bilinguals in two experiments, described below. The additional funds are requested to allow a student with a 
disability to conduct another experiment and to publish the study. Method: In two experiments, English speakers read and retold a short story before 
and after listening to a recorded story that either contained many uses of ""like"" (145), moderate uses (61) or no uses (pre-post design). The 
experiments also investigate the role of attention for alignment to ""like"". This is done by immersing participants in Google Earth in virtual reality: Half 
navigated with the hand-held controllers (heavy attentional load), and half remained stationary (light attentional load). Current results: When the 
attentional load was during comprehension, participants aligned to ""like"" after being exposed to many (as opposed to moderate) ""likes"". In addition, 
contrary to expectations, they aligned to ""like"" in the heavy load condition, which presumably enhanced their overall attention to the situation and 
hence to the ""likes"" in the input. When the attentional load was during production, participants similarly aligned to ""like"" after being exposed to many 
(as opposed to moderate) ""likes"", but only under light and not under heavier load. These results suggest that even aligning to an implicit (and often 
undesirable) aspect of language such as the filler word ""like"" draws on attentional resources. 
However, to be able to publish these results, a third experiment is necessary without the virtual reality manipulation. Removing virtual reality will 
allow to fully interpret the effects of attentional engagement on alignment to ""like"". We request additional funds (20% of the original proposal) to 
increase the chances that a graduate student with a disability is retained in academia.

useful especially for determining the presence of point defects and in semi-quantitatively measuring 
annealing defects or the presence of contaminants [1-5]. In addition to spectral analysis by Raman 
spectroscopy, confocal Raman mapping will also be used to directly visualize the local distribution of

Artificial 
light induced disruptions of those cycles affect the structure and function of multiple levels of biodiversity. As artificial 
light continues to increase, it is crucial to understand how animals are altering their behaviors. Artificial lighting is 
introducing both intensities and wavelengths of light that mask or destroy the natural light environments upon which 
organisms depend for carrying out biological functions such as foraging, habitat selection, and predator avoidance. To 
cope with these novel, artificial conditions, species must modify their behaviors, possibly leading to shifts in predator-
prey interactions. Nocturnal ambush mesopredators are central to these interactions and rely upon darkness for hunting 
and concealment, making them particularly likely to alter their behavior under the constant presence of artificial light. 
Rattlesnakes, with their nocturnal habits, ambush foraging, and dependence upon crypsis for concealment, offer an ideal 
system to investigate the impact of both natural and artificial light on ambush mesopredators. Our proposed project uses 
rattlesnakes and associated species (e.g. rodents, coyotes, owls) to evaluate light environment effects on predator-prey 
behaviors and dynamics through three aims: 1) spatiotemporal dynamics of predator-prey interactions, 2) altered 
crypsis, and 3) foraging success. We propose eight experiments including in situ organismal tracking, field 
manipulations, and controlled mesocosm experiments. The 2020 World Biodiversity forum posed 11 pressing research 
questions on how artificial light affects biodiversity and organisms. Our proposed research will contribute answers to 
seven of 11 important themes. Numerous recent reviews and perspectives have called for understanding 
how natural light drives organismal spatiotemporal dynamics and the consequences of artificial light. The results of 
these experiments will contribute to understanding how landscape alterations of the visual environment modifies 
behaviors and morphology of prey, mesopredators, and apex predators in undisturbed Chihuahuan Desert.

specific objective of the research will focus on mitigating PFAS exposure from the food supply
through the exploration of different biochar applications as soil amendment to reduce PFAS
bioaccumulation in plants in agricultural settings to promote farm viability and public health. The
proposed research aims to enhance cost-effective solutions and management strategies tailored
to address PFAS concerns in agricultural environments. This includes developing strategies
applicable to farms dealing with high volumes of water or soil characterized by relatively low
PFAS concentrations.

The goal of this program is to advance understanding of the recognized and emerging changes occurring across Arctic tundra ecosystems by 
sustaining and enhancing the value of the datasets collected by the International Tundra Experiment - Arctic Observatory Network (ITEX-AON).  
Specifically, this proposal will: sustain the data-streams at the primary ITEX-AON sites near Toolik Lake, Imnavait Creek, Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), 
and Atqasuk; expand observations of carbon dynamics to include Thule and Utqiagvik; collaborate closely with the Circumarctic Active Layer 
Monitoring (CALM) network to understand the interactions between snow cover, thaw, subsidence, vegetation change, and carbon exchange at 
multiple sites across Arctic Alaska; support the archival of observations across the ITEX network and continue syntheses focused on phenocam 
imagery; and increase scientific literacy by partnering with community organizations and K-12 teachers.

 Research goals. This project aims to make early attempts to integrate a useful metric of social psychology, 
called social value orientation (SVO) [5, 6], into emerging mobility systems for the altruistic control design of 
AVs. The SVO of an AV enables it to influence the behavior of following HVs, a crucial aspect as AVs behaving 
in a socially compliant manner allow human drivers to understand their actions and respond appropriately. 
Specifically, the research will (i) collect naturalistic driving data at the trajectory level to analyze the 
comprehensive car-following behavior of ACC vehicles through field experiments, (ii) calibrate microscopic 
car-following models to describe the behavior of AVs with low levels of driving automation, (iii) integrate SVO 
into AV operation for socially compliant control design, and (iv) implement the novel AV control algorithms in 
simulation to conduct prospective analyses and explore potential implications on mixed vehicle traffic, including 
the fundamental diagram, traffic safety, and emissions impacts. This research aims to prepare transportation 
practitioners and future graduates for emerging technologies in vehicle automation. The ultimate goal is to 
expedite the transfer of knowledge gained from this research into real-world transportation engineering 
practices. Furthermore, this study will provide invaluable empirical datasets, models, and vehicle control 
algorithms to benefit the broader community of transportation and automotive researchers and practitioners.
