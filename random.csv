ENTER A BRIEF  DESCRIPTION (ABSTRACT) OF PROJECT/ACTIVITY ( in layman’s terms for publication purposes ) 
In support of Topic 1: Precise attitu de control and pointing systems for cubesats, the project will incorporate the High - 
Test Peroxide (HTP) micro -thruster developed and demonstrated by firings at the University of Texas at El Paso  
(UTEP) into a precise attitude control system for CubeSats.   The propulsion module will be sized to fit in a 1U  
CubeSat volume (10 x 10x 10 cm).  The demonstrated specific impulse (Isp) will provide approximately twice the Isp of  
cold gas systems.  It will also be demonstrated that the higher performance and rel atively benign exhaust products,  
water and oxygen, can be safely achieved after long -term storage.

Proposal Title : Development of Precise Modular Attitude Control or Deorbit Systems using High-Test Peroxide for CubeSats
SECTION VII - Project Summary
A modular propulsion system for a CubeSat spacecraft will be built using a green propellant, High-Test Peroxide (HTP), as a
 monopropellant. The propellant handling requirements are well known and the exhaust products are water and oxygen at a relatively
 low temperature (< 980°C). The low thrust level (0.1 to 0.5 N) can be used for spacecraft attitude control and small orbit changes.
 The system will provide 325 m/s of delta-velocity for a 1 kg CubeSat spacecraft. The propellant tank and thruster assembly will be
 supported by a standard 1U CubeSat structure with resulting exterior dimensions of 10x10x16 cm. The propellant is stored in a high-
strength sealed tank that can be placed into a spacecraft launch vehicle. Low power, low voltage valves will provide propellant flow
 control using blow down tank pressure management.FORM NRESS-300 Version 3.0 Apr 09PI Name : Ahsan Choudhuri

Center for Space Exploration and Technology Research (cSETR)  
The University of Texas at El Paso  Section 2.  Relevance and Impact   
a. Technology Description  
High -Test Peroxide (HTP) [85 -94% H2O2] has been used for decades as a monopropellant 
and gas generator in larger scale applications. The Center for Space Exploration and Technology 
Research (cSETR) at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) established by a 5 -year grant from 
NASA (recently re newed for 5 years) has used teams of graduate and undergraduate students to 
create monopropellant thruster designs with green monopropellants. The cSETR has  developed a 
High-Test P eroxide T hruster (HTPT)  using a silver catalyst bed contained inside a press ure 
chamber1. This micro -thruster has produced thrust and firings as shown by Fig. 1 .     
This thruster design will be incorporated into  a small (1U) volume modular propulsion 
system to provide attitude control and pointing capability to a CubeSat spacecra ft thereby 
expanding the mission c apability for small satellites. Firing pairs of thrusters to rotate the 
spacecraft around its rotational axes can provide three -axis pointing control for the vehicle. Firing 
all four thrusters simultaneously could generate  a delta -V for orbit change or deorbit .   
A blow -down propellant tank will be fabricated using 3D printing capability at the UTEP 
W. M. Keck Center  for 3D Innovation . The tank will use a blow -down ratio of 4:1. A survey of 
commercial off -the-shelf (COTS)  valve  suppliers will be made to select components that can be 
used in the system.  These will consist of low voltage, low flow flight weight valves for use on the 
thruster, a latching tank isolation valve, manual fill and drain valves for the pressurizing gas and 
propellant, and sensors for tank pressure and temperature of the thrust units. Table 1 describes the 
proposed system.

The propulsion  module will enable attitude control of small satellites thereby greatly 
increasing their capability to perform more complicated missions. The increase in specific impulse 
and energy density of HTP over cold gas provide s twice the total impulse for the same propulsion 
system volume. The program will demonstrate the thruster repeatability with flight type valves 
over the range of blow -down of tank pressures  from 690  to 170 kPa.  
 
b. Comparison to State -of-the-Art 
The proposed system uses “Green Propellant HTP” to provide twice the specific impulse 
of cold gas systems with relatively benign exhaust gases, water and oxygen, as opposed to 
hydrazine which  is more toxic to handle and has more aggressive  exhaust products.  The system 
will provide a delta -velocity capability of 325 m/s for a CubeSat with the propulsion module 
attached that can be used to make changes in orbit angle or height. A satellite in low Earth orbit 
would require 135 m/s to make a 1 -degree plane change. An increase of the orbit height by 1 km 
would use 0.56 m/s. These values apply for a 250 km height orbit and decrease slightly as the orbit 
height is increased. Attitude control of a satellite is highly dependent upon the mass distribu tion, 
moment of inertia, and pointing accuracy requirements of the mission . Similar analysis is reported 
in Refs. 1 -3. 
The low thrust of this system would provide significant amounts of attitude control 
however detailed analysis using the actual moments of  inertia and mission requirements will be 
required.  The firing sequences planned will provide impulse bit , thrust level response, and steady 
state specific impulse for this configuration . The propulsion module will provide an interface to 
satellite control  computer and use the system power buss or could be configured to be a standalone 
with a control computer, sensor interfaces and separate power supply.  The figures of mer it 
evaluation are described in T able 2.

Accuracy and 
Precision  Extensive thrust measurement and duty cycle testing on four 
development thrusters will provide impulse bit and engine -to-engine 
repeatability measurements. The performance will be measured over the 
range of HTP concentrations. A precision thrust measurement stand will 
be used.     4 
     
 
Center for Space Exploration and Technology Research (cSETR)  
The University of Texas at El Paso  Adaptability and 
Flexibility  The system design can easily be scaled to provide higher thrust levels. 
The design capability to use larger propellant tanks (outside the 1U 
configuration) or connect in parallel to another 1U tank. The system 
could also use a single higher thrust engine if required by the mission  for 
orbit changes . 
Cost (non -
recurring)  An innovative feature is fabrication of a high strength titanium 
propellant tank using 3D p rinting to form the tank membrane and attach 
mounts as an integral assembly. This will create a low cost tank 
assembly.  COTS valves will be used.  
Cost (recurring)  There are no recurring costs as this is a single use item.  
Efficiency  The design uses all o f the volume of a 1U CubeSat and enables attitude 
control with twice the specific impulse of cold gas.  
Mass  The dry weight of the propulsion module is estimated at 0.8 kg.   
Operating 
Lifetime  The thruster life will far exceed the propellant load.  
Power  Power use is only when the thruster are operated and is 0.9 watts.  
Reliability  All system components are COTS or will be proven during the 
optimization and verification tests. Single fault tolerance will be used 
since no catastrophe failure is envi sioned.  
Safety  HTP as a green propellant is less toxic than hydrazine and handling 
processes are well known. A sealed tank demonstration test will prove 
that decomposition of the HTP is slow enough to be contained in a tank 
for the time before vehicle loa ding and launch. The tank has a high burst 
pressure (> 20.7 MPa ). It is anticipated that propellant loading will occur 
about 12 months before launch.  
Strength  Standard COTS parts will be incorporated into a compact design volume 
with sufficient support to meet a normal launch environment . 
Tolerance to 
Radiation  All materials are tolerant, any vehicle control computer would use 
radiation hardened computation units.  
Tolerance to 
temperature 
extremes and 
cycles  HTP will be limited to a maximum temperature o f 50°C and will freeze 
at about 0°C . 
Volume  The 1 U propulsion module is 10 x 10 x  16 cm. 
 
c. Technology Readiness Level (TRL)  
The thruster is at TRL 3 (proof of concept) as shown by the firing test figure 1. The completed 
testing has shown that the catalyst bed requ ires more silver contact area. An optimization  to the 
design using silver mesh is in process. This program will optimize the catalyst bed ; demonstrate 
the performance characteristics and duty cycle sensitivity. Individual thruster tests wi ll show 
engine -to-engine repeatability, cold start thrust transients and steady state thrust and specific 
impulse ov er the operating pressure range . 
 
d. Infusion Potential  
Small satellite designers can use this modular propulsion system to enable attitude control with a 
low cost, environmentally compatible system.     5

Section 3.  Objectives and Approach  
a. Approach  
cSETR  has extensive microthruster test capabilities including  high speed data acquisition systems,  
thrust measurement stand,  vacuum chamber,  propellant handling test procedures , and operational 
processes.  The proposed effort includes optimization and verification  of thruster performance , 
optimization of propellant dwell time in the catalyst bed, demonstration of  performance over a 
range of inlet pressures and integration of 
the thruster  (shown in Fig. 2). The existing 
equipment and thruster design will be used 
to ultimately create  a modular propulsion 
system with the dimensions  of a 1U 
CubeSat  as shown in Fig. 3.  
A sequence of design reviews 
similar will be used to provide design 
integrity and  to maximize the cSETR’s 
NASA partner’s contribution in developing 
and defining requirements for space vehicle 
and system design. The sequence of reviews 
to be used involves system requirements 
review (SRR), preliminary design r eview (PDR), critical design review (CDR), and test readiness 
review (TRR). The cSETR staff engineers have experience in the design and review process and 
will mentor the team to ensure the results are accurate, repeatable and documented . The objectives 
and their respectiv e milestones are summarized in T able 3.

Thruster performance o ptimization and verification tests will be run on multiple valve -
thruster assemblies using the flight engine hardware and valve with and a facility tank to 
demonstrate engine -to-engine repeatability, impulse bit, thrust level at beginning of life and at end 
of life as a function of thruster inlet pressure.  
The initial activity will document the detailed design requirements of the system and each 
of the COTS components. The NASA partner, GRC, will review our test results, help define 
vehicle requirements, assist with interface definition and provide expertise  about the end use such 
as vehicle control, launch vehicle interfaces, and propellant handling and safety issues.  
Components will be manual fill and drain valves, latch valve used to isolate the tank from 
the thruster propellant manifold, and for thruster flow control valves. These will be low voltage, 
low flow devices that are suitable for use with HTP propellant.  
The cSETR will design and fabricate the micro -propellant tank  and manifolds that form 
the fluid flow paths shown in Fig.  4. Two parallel constru ction methods  will be used to ensure 
success. The primary approach will use 3D printing manufacturing to construct a tank shell with 
integral support points and inlet/outlet interfaces for the propellant and pressurizing gas. UTEP 
has 3D printing capabilit y at the W.M. Keck Center. An alternate fabrication approach would be 
to mill the tank wall from a titanium block using CNC process. This older technology should be 
more costly but provides  less risk.  An elastomer diaphragm will be used to provide positive  
propellant expulsion. The system will operate in blow -down mode using a conservative blow -
down ratio of 4:1. Nitrogen will be used to provide the pressure at about 690 kPa ( 100 psia ) initial 
pressure.  
The system integration task to incorporate the thrust ers, tank and valves into a modular 
configuration will be done using CAD and design interfaces. The final configuration will use a 
welded assembly to eliminate leaks. Electrical connectors will be used to ensure correct wiring 
and accurate interface to the  vehicle power buss and data acquisition system. The system will 
provide a tank pressure sensor, thruster temperature sensors to ensure safe operation and control 
of the propulsion module on the satellite. Several options exist for power supply and system 
control. These will be explored with the NASA partner to ensure useable parameters are chosen.  
An operational analysis of the propulsion system will be made to demonstrate the 
application of the propulsion module to a Cub eSat vehicle and launch system. The  requirements 
for an effective qualification program will be defined in conjunction with the NASA partner to 
define launch loads for vibration, acceleration, temperature variation, and handling and shipping. 
This program will define a baseline for any pote ntial users of the propulsion system. The 
performance of these qualification tests will not be part of the planned program.

Center for Space Exploration and Technology Research (cSETR)  
The University of Texas at El Paso  b. Challenges and Risk  
HTP propellant has a known concern of storability. HTP decomposes when heated, when exposed 
to an organic residue, or slowly decomposes with time. When used for a mission, these propulsion 
modules will be loaded with propellant and stored for extended times while waiting for launch. 
The program will demonstrate that with intense multiple passivation cycles and  material 
compatibility, the rate of decomposition that the unit can safely be stored at without over -
pressurizing for at least one year . Three years of sealed storage was demonstrated in 1965 and 15 
years is estimat ed to be possible per Ref. 3 . The tank w ill be filled with propellant and the tank 
pressure will be monitored for a minimum of 1 year over a range of temperature environments up 
to 45 °C. The thrust response time and life of the catalyst bed depends upon the duty cycle and the 
propellant throughp ut. The program will demonstrate cold start capability and the effects of 
operating life upon the thruster during the verification firing tests with the flight type valve. 
Operational life of a micro -monopropellant thruster will require optimization of the  catalyst bed 
configuration and dwell time of the propellant in the chamber. Tolerance for cold starts and 
thruster -to-thruster repeatability will be shown early in the program. Thermal analysis will 
demonstrate thermal isolation of the thruster valve from  the chamber. Structural margins will be 
calculated and operational temperatures demonstrated for space operation and typical launch 
vehicle vibration loads.    
 
c. Equipment and Facilities  
The cSETR laboratory and personnel have micro -thrust measurement capability, micro 
flow meters and data acquisition systems,  vacuum chamber  propellant handling expertise and test 
operation experience. Training is given to all team members to ensure safe operation. Propellant 
quantities are limited to reduce risk. UTEP h as additive manufacturing expertise at the W.M. Keck 
Center and equipment to do titanium 3D printing. Additionally, CNC machining is available as 
well as CAD modeling, CFD analysis and combustion expertise.  Furthermore, the cSETR has the 
capability of cond ucting altitude simulation testing with two vacuum chambers available at the 
facility.

a. Project Management  
The cSETR uses a project team of graduate and undergraduate students focused on the 
assigned task. The teams are mentored by the PI and cSETR staff engineers using direct contact 
and a sequence of formal design 
reviews. The design reviews 
emulate the desig n process used 
at NASA and throughout the 
aerospace industry. The program 
will define requirements for a 
system requirements review 
(SRR), a preliminary design 
review (PDR), a critical design 
review (CDR) , and a test 
readiness review (TRR)  for each 
set of components and the total 
system integration. In addition to 
the significant design reviews 
mentioned previously, biweekly 
status reviews and working 
sessions will be coordinated to 
ensure success of the program .

Brief Summary: Use of High -Test Peroxide ( HTP ) propellant for attitude control of small 
satellites will enable greater mission capability due the higher s pecific impulse over cold gas. The 
proposed effort takes the proof of concept level thruster tests through a demonstration of safe 
operation and thr uster repeatability and system integr ation for a modular 1U system. Additional 
verification testing of the thruster performance will demonstrate propellant use and e ngine -to-
engine repeatability. Micro tank design will be demonstrated as well as propellant  storage  issues 
for decomposition of HTP.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   
 
This NASA Research Announcement (NRA), entitled “ Space Technology 
Research, Development, Demonstration , and Infusion- 2015 (SpaceTech -
REDDI -2015 )” is NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate’s (STMD) annual 
umbrella solicitation.  The following STMD programs will be included in the 
solicitation:  
 
NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC),  Space Technology Research Grant s (STRG),  
Game Changing Development  (GCD) ,  
Small Spacecraft Technology  (SST ),  
Technology Demonstration Missions (TDM) and  
Flight Opportunities Program (FOP) 
 
The Space Technology portfolio supports a combination of early stage studies, for 
assessing the feasibility of entirely new technologies ( which corresponds to a 
Technology Readiness Level (TRL) range from 1 to 3); maturing feasible 
technologies through rapid competitive development and ground based testing (TRL 
3-5); and flight demonstrations in a relevant environment to complete the final step to 
mission infusion (TRL 5 -7) (Attachment 2 “Technology Readiness Level 
Descriptions ”).  This technological diversity results in a sustainable pipeline of 
revolutionary concepts.  STMD seeks a ggressive technology development efforts 
that may require undertaking significant technical challenges and risk to achieve a 
higher potential payoff.  
 
The focus of this solicitation  is to bring the best ideas and talents from all sectors of  
the aerospace enterprise to solve future technology needs while ma ximizing the 
value of the Nation’s investment.  Investing in space technology invests in the future 
of NASA, the U.S. space program, and the Nation.   
 
To the greatest extent practicable, participation w ill be open to all categories of 
organizations, domestic and foreign, including industry, educational institutions, 
nonprofit organizations, NASA centers, and other Government agencies.  Foreign entities may also partner with U .S. proposers, but only without an exchange of 
funding.  
 Proposals for technology research, development and demonstration in support of STMD will be solicited through Appendices under this umbrella solicitation  as 
technology topics are defined and funding is made available  for new opportunities .  
For informational purposes, we have included the Appendix target release dates on 
page vi.  The Appendices will provide key information including: specific scope of the 
work solicited, anticipated budget for new awards, number of awards anticipated, notice of intent and proposal due dates, and specific instructions about proposal 
content and evaluation criteria.  The provisions in any A ppendix will apply to that 
ii 
 specific opportunity and will supersede any conflicting provisions in this umbrella 
solicitation  or in the NASA Guidebook for Proposers  (see Section 9.0 in this 
solicitation ).  
 
It is possible that additional information will become available or programmat ic 
changes may affect this umbrella solicitation  or any of the opportunities offered under 
its Appendices prior to a proposal submission deadline. If so, such information will be 
added as a formal amendment to this umbrella solicitation and posted on the 
following webpage: http://nspires.nasaprs.com .  Clarifications or questions and 
answers that are published will also be posted on this website or included in an 
amendment.  It is eac h prospective offeror ’s responsibility  to check this webpage for 
updates concerning the programs of interest .  
 
We enthusiastically look forward to your participation in STMD’s many upcoming 
opportunities.

SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
 
 
Additional information about STMD p rograms is available 
at http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/home/index.html . 
 By investing in high payoff, disruptive technolog ies, STMD  is able to mature the 
technolog ies required for NASA’s future m issions in science and exploration while 
proving the capabilities and lowering the cost for other government agencies and commercial space activities. By pushing the boundaries of aerospace technology and seizing opportunities, investing in space technolog y allows NASA and our Nation to 
remain at the cutting edge. NASA’s  STMD :  
 
• Advances technology that is broadly applicable to multiple customers  
• Employs a portfolio approach to capture the entire spectrum of technology 
readiness  
• Competitively selects research by academia, industry, NASA C enters, and other 
government organizations  based on technical merit  
• Coordinates with internal and external stakeholders and l everages the 
technology investments of our international, other government agency, academic and industrial partners  
• Results in new inventions, new capabilities and the creation of a pipeline of innovators aimed at serving future NASA needs and National needs  
• Grows the Nation’s innovation economy and creates high- technology jobs  
3 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
 
STMD  programs intentionally push the boundaries of what is possible with a strong 
focus on innovation.  No single effort is guaranteed to succeed and some will fail as novel approaches are attempted. While appropriate safety, design, and verification practices  are followed, STMD  programs employ a graduated technical risk tolerance 
approach.  More resources, rigor, and greater risk avoidance apply to higher cost and higher technology readiness level ( TRL) efforts, such as test articles destined for 
complex ground tests and/or space flight demonstrations.  In all cases, a transparent, informed risk acceptance approach applies.  
 The following STMD programs are included in this solicitation:  
 NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts ( NIAC) ,  
Space Technology Research Grant s (STRG),  
Game Changing Development  (GCD) ,  
Small Spacecraft Technology  (SST) ,  
Technology Demonstration Missions (TDM) and  
Flight Opportunities  Program (FOP)  
 As program requirements are defined and funding is made available, s pecific research 
and technology development opportunities will be defined and issued as App endices to 
this solicitation .  The Appendices will provide key information including:  specific scope 
of work solicited, anticipated budget  and number of awards, not ice of intent and 
proposal due dates, and specific instructions about proposal content and evaluation criteria .   
 
1.3 Space Technology Roadmaps  
 STMD programs described in section 1.2 above are aligned with the A gency’s Space 
Technology Roadmaps (STRs) (http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/roadmaps/index.html
), which reflect the National 
Research Council’s (NRC’s) review ( http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13354 ) 
of these roadmaps.  
 NASA developed the STRs in order to facilitate the development and demonstration of space technologies that address the needs of NASA’s exploration systems, earth and space science, and space operations mission areas, as well as those that contribute to 
critical national and commercial needs in advanced space technology. Each of these roadmaps focuses on a technology area. The STRs were initially drafted by NASA and subsequently independently reviewed by the NRC. The NRC’s review (link provided above) resulted in findings, recommendations, and priorities –  within and across the 
technology areas –  intended to inform NASA’s space technology investments. Offerors  
may refer to the roadmaps and the NRC final report for additional context.  
 
4 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
Finally, topic  areas solicited under this solicitation  are consistent with the NASA 
Strategic Space Technology Investment Plan 
(http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/space _tech_2013.pd f).  
 Specifically, NASA will balance investments across all levels of technology readiness. By investing in all TRLs for pioneering, crosscutting technologies , the Agency ensures a 
robust pipeline of new capabilities.  
 
1.4 NASA Safety Policy  
 Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational 
illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. NASA's safety priority is to protect the following: (1) the public, (2) astronauts and pi lots, 
(3) the NASA workforce (including employees working under NASA award instruments), and (4) high- value equipment and property.  
 
2.0 AWARD INFORMATION 
 
2.1 Funding and Period of Performance Information   
 
The Summary of Key Information section in each Appendix will provide the anticipated 
total amount of funds available, any funding limitations , potential number of proposal 
awards for each topic area and period of performance (duration) for awards .  While the 
Summary of Key Information will provide estimates for  funding and the number  of 
awards , these amounts  may vary depending on the merit of proposals submitted and 
the funding available at the time of selections.    The period of performance (duration) can range from one year for activities of limited scope to multiple years  for extensive, comprehensive activities . Offerors shall justify 
proposed period of performance in their  proposal s. The appropriateness of the 
proposed period of performance will be evaluated by peer review. NASA may select proposals for shor ter award durations than proposed (See Section 5.4) . 
 For proposals that include NASA civil servant participation, offerors total cost of the 
effort will include the proposal amount plus all NASA civil servant fully burdened costs 
(per standard NASA accounting practices for the work -years proposed) .  The total cost 
of the effort will be compared to the amount of funds available per award.  For example: if the offeror’s proposed cost is $100K and the NASA civil servant cost is 15K, then the total cost of the effort is $115K.  
 
STMD’s goal is to initiate new awards as quickly  as possible after the selection of 
proposals is announced.  However, NASA may take longer to make the awards, based on workload, availability of appropriated funds, and any necessary  post-selection 
negotiations with the proposing organizations. To help expedite the processing of awards, offerors  are reminded to submit all required information;  including  full and 
detailed explanations for the requested budget should their proposal be s elected.  
5 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
 
Awards made through this solicitation may be in the form of grants, cooperative 
agreements, or contracts depending on the specific requirements for award as set forth 
in the A ppendices and the nature of the proposing organization.   Appendices may 
specify a particular type of instrument for award.   Inter -agency and intra- agency actions 
may be used to fund selected proposals from other federal agencies or NASA C enters.  
The type of award to be negotiated with selected offerors  will generally follow the 
policies in Appendix D.1 of the NASA Guidebook for Proposers , although in a few 
cases, only one type of award may be offered, as specified in the Appendix.   
 
A NASA Awards Officer will determine the appropriate award instrument for the 
selections resulting from this solicitation. Grants and cooperative agreements will be 
subject to the policies and provisions identified in the regulations at 2 CFR 200 and 1800, 14 CFR 74, NASA GCAM, and Appendix D of the NASA Guidebook for Propos ers. In the case of any conflict, the regulations at 2 CFR 200 and 1800 and the 
GCAM takes precedence over the NASA Guidebook for Proposers. Contract awards will be subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) http://www.acquisiti on.gov/far/index.html and the NASA FAR Supplement 
(NFS) http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/nfstoc.htm
. 
 
2.2 Availability of Funds for Awards  
 There is no funding associated w ith this umbrella solicitation.   All funding will be 
associated with each particular  Appendi x.  The Government’s ability  to make awards  is 
contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds and the receipt of proposals that NASA determines are acceptable for award under this solicitation .  
 NASA reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals in response to an Appendix call for proposals .  NASA provides no funding for 
reimbursement of proposal development costs. Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this solicitation  will not be returned.  It is the 
policy of NASA to tr eat all proposals as competition  sensitive information and to 
disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation.  
 
2.3 Award Reporting Requirements  
 Required reports for contract awards will be negotiated with the offeror and be subject to the FAR and  NASA FAR Supplement. Required reports for grants and cooperative 
agreements are covered in 2 CFR 1800.902 and the GCAM, Exhibit E ‘Technical Publications and Reports.’  
 
2.4  Successor Proposals and Resubmissions  
 Generally, award recipients  holding previous awards selected through any of the 
opportunities offered through earlier solicitations are welcome to submit “successor” proposals that seek to continue a previously funded line of research (see Section 1.5 of 
6 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
the NASA Guidebook for Proposers ).  However, to ensure equitable treatment of all 
submitted proposals, NASA does not extend any special consideration to such 
successor proposals in terms of preferential handling, review, or priority for selection.   
 Proposals  that were submitted but  not selected for any previous NASA solicitation may 
be submitted either in a revised or original form  but must conform to the requirements of 
the particular Appendix .  Such submissions will be treated as new proposals and will be 
subjected to a full peer review.  
 Funds provided through instruments awarded under this solicitation cannot be applied 
as contributions to  Space Act Agreements or other NASA awards .    
 
2.5 Use and Disclosure of Research Resulting From Awards  
 As a Federal Agency, NASA requires promp t public disclosure of the results of its 
sponsored research to generate knowledge that benefits the Nation.  Thus, it is NASA’s intent that all knowledge developed under  awards resulting from this solicitation  be 
shared broadly.  In certain STMD programs,  award recipients will be expected to publish 
their work in peer -reviewed, open literature publications to the greatest extent practical.   
 NASA recognizes that there are cases when data cannot be disclosed to  the public 
(e.g., export controlled data).  E ven in these cases, offerors  are expected to publish 
data to the greatest extent possible (e.g., use normalized data or at least discuss new methodologies used with clean “test cases”).  NASA also understands that offerors  may 
have legitimate proprietary i nterests in the technology or data they have produced at 
their own expense.  If results must include proprietary or restricted information, that information should be appropriately  marked and segregated into a separate A ppendix 
that will not be publicly di sseminated.  A publicly releasable version of the final report 
and other deliverables shall be otherwise complete and comprehensive.  
 On February 22, 2013, the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) issued a Memorandum for the Heads of Executive De partments and Agencies entitled 
“Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research” that requested a plan for improving the public’s access to the results of federally funded research. Promoting the full and open sharing of data with the research communities, 
private industry, academia, and the general public is a longstanding core value of NASA. Accordingly, NASA developed a plan in response to the new OSTP requirement that extends NASA’s open access culture to data and publications,  entitled: “The NASA 
Plan for Increasing Access to Results of Federally Funded Research”, which can be found at:  http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2014/12/05/NASA_Plan_for_increasing_access_to_results_of_federally_funded_research.pdf  
 In keeping with this plan, specific data archival terms and conditions will be included in applicable Appendices to this SpaceTech- REDDI NRA.

Title and Rights in Property.  A stated purpose of NASA under the National Aeronautics 
and Spac e Act is to seek and encourage the commercial use of space.  During 
negotiations, offerors should identify where title to property resulting from project activities is critical to their commercialization efforts.  NASA will determine whether title to property will remain with offerors for a specified period, to be negotiated at the time of 
award.  
 
2.7 Cost-Sharing or Matching  
For contracts, c riteria and procedures for the allowability and allocability of cash and 
non-cash contributions shall be governed by  FAR Parts 30 and 31, and NFS Parts 1830 
and 1831.  
For an institution of higher education, hospital, or other non- profit organization seeking 
to receive a grant or cooperative agreement, cost -sharing is not required; however, 
NASA can accept cost sharing i f it is voluntarily offered. See CFR 200.306, 2 CFR 
1800.306 and 2 CFR 1800.922 for more information on Cost Sharing.    
For a commercial firm seeking to receive a grant or cooperative agreement, cost 
sharing is required as defined in 14 CFR 1274, unless t he commercial firm can 
demonstrate that they will not receive substantial compensating benefits for performance of the work. If no substantial compensating benefits will be received, cost sharing is not required but can be accepted. The regulations at 2 CF R 200.306, 2 CFR 
1800.306 and 2 CFR 1800.922 describe cost sharing and allowability for awards. Acceptable forms of cost sharing for commercial firms are discussed in the Regulations at 14 CFR 1274.204, ‘Costs and Payments,’ located at http://prod.nais.nas a.gov/pub/pub_library/grantd.html#1274204) . 
 
2.8 International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)  and Export  
Administration Regulations ( EAR) Requirements  
 It is incumbent upon the offeror to assure the protection and nondisclosure of relevant technical data, including requirements of the Export Administration Regulations ( EAR) 
and International Traffic in Arms Regulations  (ITAR ). U.S. offerors are required to know 
when hardware, software, or related materials and services, including technical data, 
are subject to U.S. export control laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Act, the 
Arms Export Control Act, and their associated regulations. It is incumbent upon the U.S. offeror to strictly comply with all U.S. export control laws, and when applicable, assume the responsibility for obtaining export licenses, or other export authority, as may be required.  
 Under U.S. law and regulations, spacecraft and their specifically designed, modified, or configured systems, components, and parts are generally c onsidered ""Defense Articles"" 
on the United States Munitions List and are, therefore, subject to the provisions of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120- 130.  It is the 
9 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
offeror’s responsibility to determine whether any proposal information is subject to the 
provisions of ITAR, and to comply with the provisions of ITAR.  Information about U.S. export regulations is available at http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/ and http://www.bis.doc.gov/
. 
 
3.0 ELIGIBILITY INFORMATI ON  
 To the greatest extent practicable, p articipation  will be  open to all categories of U.S. and 
non-U.S. organizations, including educational, industr y, nonprofit institutions , Federally 
Funded Research and Development  Centers (FFRDC) , University Affiliated Research 
Centers (UARCs), NASA Centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and other Government agencies.  Historically Black  Colleges and Universities (HBCU), o ther 
minority universities (OMU), small disadvantaged businesses (SDB ), veteran- owned 
small businesses, service disabled veteran- owned small businesses, HUBZone small 
businesses, and w omen -owned small businesses (WOSB) are encouraged to apply.   
However, Appendices may identify specific eligibility limitations  that apply to that 
opportunity . 
 
3.1 Limit ation on Number of Proposals per Organization   
 Unless Appendices specify additional information or provide limitations on the number of proposals that may be submitted by an organization, t here is no restriction on t he 
number of proposals that an organization may submit  in response to an Appendix  or on 
teaming arrangements for any one proposal.  Each proposal must be a separate, stand-
alone, complete document for evaluation purposes.   
 
3.2 Other Eligibility Limitations  
 Proposing to more than one Appendix  simultaneously or with overlapping timeframes is 
permitted, provided the proposed efforts are appropriate for the solicitations and the offeror can carry out all proposed efforts, if selected.  Appendices may also identi fy 
other eligibility restrictions such as limitations on the number of proposals that a PI or 
key participant may submit.  
 
3.3 Foreign Participation 
 Participation by eligible non-U.S. organizations  is also permitted,  but subject to NASA’s 
policy of no- exchang e-of-funds , in which each government supports its own national 
participants and accounts for associated costs (further information on foreign 
participation is provided in Section 1.6 of the NASA Guidebook for Proposers ).  NASA’s 
policy is to conduct resear ch with foreign entities on a cooperative, no- exchange- of-
funds basis (see NPD 1360.2B, Initiation and Development of International Cooperation 
in Space and Aeronautics Programs, (http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?t=NPD&c=1360&s=2B
).  Should a foreign 
proposal or a U.S. proposal with foreign participation be selected, NASA’s Office of International and Interagency Relations will arrange with the sponsoring foreign agency 
10 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
or funding/sponsoring institution for the proposed participation on a no -exchange- of-
funds basis, in which NASA and the non- U.S. sponsoring agency or funding/sponsoring 
institution will each bear the cost of discharging their respective responsibilities.  
 
For grants and cooperative agreements, NASA policy on research w ith foreign 
organizations is covered in 2 CFR 1800.3.  
 For contracts, NASA policy on research with foreign organizations is covered in paragraph (l) of NFS provision 1852.235- 72, Instructions for Resp onding to NASA 
Research Announcements (http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/nfstoc.htm
).   
 NASA funding may not be used for subcontracted foreign research efforts.  The direct purchase of supplies/services, which do not constitute research, from non- U.S. sources 
by U.S. award recipients is permitted, subject to the provisions or terms of the award.   
However, subject to export control restrictions, a foreign national may receive remuneration through a NASA award for the conduct of research while employed either 
full or part time by a U.S. organization (see Section 1.6 of the NASA Guidebook for 
Proposers ). 
 
3.4 China Funding Restriction  
 Proposals must not include bilateral participation, collaboration, or coordination with China or any Chinese- owned company or entity, whether funded or performed under a 
no-exchange- of funds arrangement.  Grant Information Circular 12- 01A instructs NASA, 
when issuing new NASA Research Announcements, to add the “Assurance of Compliance – China Funding Restriction” to the current proposal requirements.  
 The FY 15 Omnibus Appropriations Act, Public Law 113- 235 Section 532 states that:  
 (1) NASA is restricted from using funds appropriated in the Acts to enter into or fund any grant or cooperative agreement of any kind to participate, collaborate, or coordinate bilaterally with China or any Chinese- owned company, at the prime recipient level and 
at all subrecipient levels, whether the bilateral involvement is funded or performed under a no exchange of funds arrangement.  
 (2) Definition: “China or Chinese- owned Company” means the People’s Republic of 
China, any company owned by the People’s Republic of China, or any company incorporated under the laws of the People’s Republic of China.  
 (3) The restrictions in the Acts do not apply to commercial items of supply needed to perform a grant or cooperative agreement.  
 (4) By submission of its proposal, the proposer represents that the proposer is not China or a Chinese- owned company, and that the proposer will not participate, 
collaborate, or coordinate bilaterally with China or any Chinese- owned company, at the 
11 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
prime recipient level or at any subrecipient level, whether the bilateral involvement is 
funded or performed under a no- exchange of funds arrangement.  
 NASA anticipates this restriction will be contained in future appropriation acts.  Active Procurement Information Circular (PIC) 12- 01A instructs Contracting Officers to add 
certification NFS 1852.225- 72 entitled “Restriction on Funding Activity w ith China –  
Representation” as well as NFS clause 1852.225- 71 entitled “Restriction on Funding 
Activity with China” in all contract awards.  
 
4.0 PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION  
 Some programs will use a one- step submission process while others may use a two-
step submission process.  Each Appendi x will identify whether proposals will be 
requested, evaluated and selected through a one-step or two -step process and whether 
the resulting award will involve phases in accordance with NFS 1817.73 , Phased 
Acquisition . 
 
4.1 Introduction   
 All information needed to respond to Appendices issued in accordance with this 
solicitation is contained in this solicitation , the relevant Appendices  and in the May 2014 
edition of the  NASA Guidebook for Proposers, located at 
http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/nraguidebook/ .  Offerors  are responsible for 
understanding and complying with the procedures in this Guidebook before preparing and submitting proposals.  Proposals that do not conform to the standards outlined may  
be declared noncompliant and rejected without review.   Where this solicitation and 
the NASA Guidebook for Proposers  are in conflict, th is solicitation takes 
precedence.  In addition, t he provisions in any Appendix will apply to that specific 
opportunity and will supersede any conflicting provisions in this solicitation  or in 
the NASA Guidebook for Proposers .  
 
4.2 Registration  
 In order to submit a proposal, all team members and their insti tutions must  be registered 
in NASA’s proposal data system: NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review 
and Evaluation System (NSPIRES) (http://nspires.nasaprs.com). Therefore, every 
organization (including Co- I organizations, educational institutions,  industry, not -
for-profit institutions, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA Centers and other 
U.S. Government agencies) that intends to submit a proposal to NASA in response to this solicitation , whether submitting through Grants.gov or the 
NSPIRES system,  must also be registered in NSPIRES.  Every organization that 
intends to submit a proposal through Grants.gov must be registered in both  Grants.gov 
and NSPIRES.  Details of the multi -step registration process, which takes about 3 
business days (or up to four weeks if all steps are not completed in a timely manner) to register a new institution, are described in the Applicant User Guide. Go to  
12 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/home.html  and search site content for Applicant User 
Guide.  
 
Registration in NSPIRES cannot be accomplished until each applicable institution obtains a Data Universal Number (DUNS) and register s in the System for Award 
Management (SAM). Once the DUNS and SAM steps are complete, the institutions and 
each team member shall then register with NSPIRES and with Grants.gov , if that 
submission process will be used.  
 Offerors submitting proposals through Grants .gov:  
Registration in NSPIRES is required in order to complete transfer of the Grants.gov 
proposal to NASA for review. Linking a team member’s registration with their institution will automatically associate all required information  (DUNS, CAGE, EIN) with the 
proposal.  
 Registration for either proposal submittal  system must be performed by an 
organization’s  Authorized Organizational Representative  (AOR).  To identify the AOR, 
the PI should contact his or her Sponsored Research Office (SRO)  or 
Electronic 
Business Point of Contact (E -Biz POC) . The NSPIRES Help Desk can also determine 
who the AOR is from the SAM system. If an institution is not registered in the SAM database, then the point of contact from the Office of Sponsored Research or the E -Biz 
POC  shall register it on the SAM webpage (http://www.sam.gov). See the Applicant 
User Guide referenced above.  
 No later than the due date for proposals, offerors  are required to obtain:  
1) An employee identification number ( EIN) for the entity . The EIN number or 
Employer Identification is also commonly called the Tax Identifi cation Number  
(TIN). Your TIN/EIN can be obtained from the IRS  website.  
2) A Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number : Information regarding 
obtaining a DUNS number may be found at http://www.dnb.com/
. 
3) A valid registration with the System for Award Manageme nt (SAM) [formerly 
known as the Central Contractor Registry (CCR)] : Information regarding SAM may 
be found at  https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ . 
4) A valid Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code : Information regarding 
CAGE codes may be found at  http://www.dlis.dla.mil/cage_welcome.asp . 
5) A valid registration with NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and 
Evaluation System (NSPIRES) .  
 IMPORTANT NOTE: FORMER CCR REGISTRANTS  
If your entity had an active record in CCR, then it has an active record in SAM. Your entity does not need to take any action with respect to SAM, unless a change in business circumstances requires updates to your entity’s record(s) in order to be paid; to receive an award; or to renew your entity(s) prior to its expiration. SAM will send notifications to the registered user via email 60, 30, and 15 days prio r to the entity’s 
expiration. To update or renew your entity’s records(s) in SAM, your entity is required to create a SAM User Account and link it to your entity’s migrated records.

4.3 Content and Form of the Proposal Submission  
 
4.3.1  Electronic Proposal Submissi on 
 All proposals submitted in response to this solicitation  
must  be submitted in electronic 
form by the AOR  at the propos ing principal investigator’s (PIs) organization who is 
authorized to make such a submission; electronic submission of the proposal by the 
AOR serves as the required original signature by an authorized official of the proposing organization.   
No hard copy of the proposal will be accepted .  Proposals submitted via 
email or any means other than NSPIRES or grants.gov will also not be accepted.  
 Appendices to this solicitation will indicate whether offerors  may submit 
proposals via one  or both of the electronic proposal submission systems: 
NSPIRES (http://nspires.nasaprs.com ) or via Grants.gov ( http://www.grants.gov
).  
Offerors submitting through Grants.gov must register in NSPIRES in order for proposals 
to be transferred by NASA to the NSPIRES  system for review .   
 Offerors  must not submit  the same proposal to both electronic submission systems.  
Full instructions for submitting proposals using the NSPIRES system are provided in 
Attachment  3 and for submitting proposals using the Grants.gov system  in Attachment  
4.   
 Note carefully the following requirements for submission of a proposal regardless of the 
intent to submit via NSPIRES or Grants.gov.  
 
• Any organization requesting NASA funds through the proposed project must be listed on the Proposal Cover Page.  NASA will not fund organizations that do not appear on the Proposal Cover Page.  
 
• Each individual team member (e.g., PI , co-investigators , collaborators ), including 
all personnel named on the proposal’s electronic cover page, must be individually registered and affili ated with their organization in NSPIRES.  This registration 
requirement applies equally for proposals submitted via Grants.gov.  Such 
individuals must perform the registration themselves; no one may register a second party, not even the PI of the proposal on which that person is committed to parti cipate. Proposals that are submitted through Grants.gov may be deemed 
non-compliant and rejected without review if the above NSPIRES registration 
requirements are not completed prior to the proposal submission deadline identified in the relevant Appendix .  
 
• Each individual team member (e.g., PI, co- investigators, collaborators ), including 
all personnel named on the proposal’s electronic cover page, must specify an organizational affiliation. The organizational affiliation specified on the cover page must be the organization through which the team member would work and 
receive funding while participating in the proposed effort. If the individual has 
multiple affiliations, then this organization may be different from the individual’s 
14 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
primary employer or prefer red mailing address. Team members are asked to 
ensure that their contact information in NSPIRES is up- to-date. Changes can be 
made using the ""Account Management"" link on the ""NSPIRES Options"" page.  
 
Submission of proposals via either NSPIRES or Grants.gov requires action by both the PI and the AOR .  First, the PI must complete all required electronic forms, and upload 
the required PDF file(s).  Second, the AOR must submit the electronic proposal on behalf of the PI.  Coordination between the PI and his/her AOR on the final editing and submission of the proposal materials is facilitated through their respective accounts in NSPIRES and/or Grants.gov.  Note that if one individual is acting in both the PI and AOR roles, he/she must ensure that all steps in the process are taken, including submitting the proposal from the organization.  
 Offerors should be sure to allow adequate time for coordination between the PI and AOR.  Depending on the organization and its internal review process, this can take several days.  The PI s are  encouraged to begin this coordination at the outset of the 
proposal preparation.  
 The proposal submission process is complex and involves multiple steps to be carried out by all participants in the proposal.  Therefore, offerors  are strongly encouraged to 
familiarize themselves with the system and begin the submittal process early, well in advance of the deadline.  While every effort is made to ensure the reliability and accessibility of submission systems and to provide a help center via e- mail and 
telephone, difficulties may arise at any point, including the user’s own equipment.  Difficulty in registering or using proposal submission systems (either NSPIRES or Grants.gov) is not a sufficient reason for NASA to consider a proposal submitted after  
the deadline.  
 
4.3.2  Notice of Intent to Propose  
 
Appendi ces will indicate whether a notice of intent (NOI) to propose is required 
for a particular opportunity.   The information contained in an NOI is used to expedite 
the proposal review activities and is , therefore,  of value to both NASA and the offeror .  
To be of  maximum value, NOIs should be submitted to NSPIRES by the date given in 
each Appendix.   Note that NOIs may be submitted within NSPIRES directly by the PI; 
no action by an organization’s AOR is required to submit an NOI.   
 Within NSPIRES, space is provided for the PI to provide the following information:  
• A short title of the anticipated proposal;  
• A full title of the anticipated proposal (which should not exceed 254 characters and is of a nature that is understandable by a scientifically trained person);  
• A brief description of the primary research area(s) and objective(s) of the anticipated investigation, including  the NASA Technology Area most closely 
associated with the  potential proposal. See the following website for additional 
information regarding N ASA’s Technology Area Breakdown: 
(http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/roadmaps/index.html) ;  
15 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
• The names of any Co -Investigators and/or Collaborators as may be known by the 
time the NOI is submitted. In order to enter such names, such team members 
must have previously accessed and registered in NSPIRES themselves; a PI 
cannot do this for them.  
 
Grants.gov does not provide NOI capability; therefore, an NOI must be submitted via NSPIRES regardless of whether the proposal will be submitted via NSPIRES or Grant s.gov.  Interested o fferors  must register with NSPIRES before they can prepare an 
NOI; see Attachment 3 to this solicitation .   
 4.3.3  Proposal Format and Contents  
 All proposals submitted in response to this solicitation must include the appropriate required el ectronic forms available through either of the two proposal submission 
systems, NSPIRES or Grants.gov.  The required sections of the proposal  must be submitted as one searchable, unlocked 
PDF file that is attached to the electronic submission using one of the proposal submission systems.   Offerors  must comply with the  format and page limit requirements 
specified in the  Appendices.  The provisions in each  Appendix will apply to that 
specific opportunity and will supersede any conflicting provisions in this 
solicitation .   
 
Important note on creating PDF files for upload:
 It is essential that all PDF files 
generated and submitted by the offeror meet NASA requirements. This will ensure that 
the submitted files can be ingested by NSPIRES regardless of whether the proposal is 
submitted via NSPIRES. At a minimum, it is the responsibility of the offerors  to: (1) 
ensure that all PDF files are unlocked and that edit permission is enabled – this is 
necessary to allow NSPIRES to concatenate submitted files into a single PDF document; and (2) ensure that all fonts are embedded in the PDF file and that only Type 1 or TrueType fonts are used. In addition, any  offeror  who creates files using TeX or 
LaTeX is required to first create a DVI file and then convert the DVI file to Postscript and then to PDF. See 
http://nspires.nasaprs.com/tutorials/PDF_Guidelines.pdf  for more 
information on creating PDF documents that are compliant with NSPIRES. PDF files that do not meet NASA requirements may be declared noncompliant and may not be 
evaluated.  
 It is each offeror ’s responsibility to verify the accuracy and completeness of his/her 
proposal, including all text, figures, tables, and required forms. NSPIRES allows applicants to verify before submission that all information contained in proposal PDF file(s) being provided to NSPIRES is complete and accurate.  
 
There is a 10MB file size limit for proposals (Section 2.3.1(c) of the NASA Guidebook 
for Proposers ).  In order to meet the 10 MB file size limit, you should crop and compress 
any embedded photos and graphic files to an appropriate size and resol ution. Only 
16 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
attachments that are specifically requested either in this solicitation or in Appendices to 
this solicitation should be submitted.  
 Requirements in the Appendi ces supersede any requirements in the NASA 
Guidebook for Proposers  or in this solici tation.  
 4.3.4  Proposal Cover Page and Proposal Attachment s 
 
In general, each proposal shall include a Proposal Cover Page and a Proposal 
Attachment  consisting of the technical/management sec tion and all other required 
attachments .  Instructions for completing the Proposal Cover Page are specific to the 
electronic proposal submission system used by the offeror (NSPIRES or Grants.gov).  Offerors  must also follow the instructions in each A ppendix regarding proposal 
organization, prop osal sections, required content, and page limits.  In some cases, not 
all sections will be required and there may be additional unique requirements.  
 
4.3.4.1.  Proposal Cover Page  
 Additional information for completing the Proposal Cover Page:  
 Proposal Summary (Abs tract):  
Both electronic systems require a Proposal Summary suitable for release through a publicly accessible archive should the proposal be selected (per Section 2.3.3 of the 
NASA Guidebook for Proposers) .  The Proposal Summary should be concise, should 
not exceed 4000 characters in length, and should not contain any special characters , 
graphics  or formatting  (use text only) . Note that, while Grants.gov does not impose a 
limit on the length of the proposal summary, it will be truncated to 4000 characters when the proposal is transmitted from Grants.gov to N SPIRES. Grants.gov users must use a 
writeable pdf form (downloadable from grants.gov) named ProposalSummary.pdf. This form restricts the Proposal Summary document to 4000 characters or less.   
 Budget : 
Both electronic systems require budget figures on the Proposal Cover Page.  Offer ors 
need to include budget figures for all years of the proposed project on the Proposal Cover Page, including subawards and NASA team member costs.  Offerors should  refer 
to section 2.3.10 of the NASA Guidebook for Proposers  and additional budget 
instructions provided in the relevant Appendix . 
 Program Specific Data (PSD) :  
This section consists of questions specific to the relevant Appendix.  Responses to the PSD questions are required regardless of whether the proposal is submitted through 
NSPIRES or Grants.gov.  NSPIRES will automatically prompt the offeror  to answer the 
PSD questions prior to submission.  Grants.gov submissions are required to include the 
NASA Program Specific Data (PSD) form.  Grants.gov submissions that do not include the NASA PSD form may be deemed non- compliant and rejected without review.  
 
17 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
Proposal Team:   
Each team member (e.g., PI, co- investigators, collaborators , graduate, undergrad uate 
students, consultants, postdoctoral associates, support staff , etc.) must register 
him/herself in NSPIRES and complete all the required information.  Each individual 
team member must also be included on the proposal’s electronic cover page. The 
organizational affiliation specified on the cover page must be the organization through which the team member would work and receive funding while participating in the proposed effort. If the individual has multiple affiliations, then this organization may be differen t from the individual’s primary employer or preferred mailing address. Team 
members are asked to ensure that their contact information in NSPIRES is up- to-date. 
Changes can be made using the ""Account Management"" link on the ""NSPIRES Options"" page.  
 Require d Certifications:   
In order to submit a proposal, the AOR of the proposing organization must read the “Certification of Compliance with Applicable Executive Orders and U.S. Code” and click the checkbox to accept the  certification s.  Attachment 5 to this s olicitation contains 
additional applicable c ertification s, assurance s and representations that are not 
referenced on the Proposal Cover P age.  The AOR’s signature on the Proposal Cover 
Page automatically certifies that the proposing organization has read and is in compliance with all the certifications  identified in Attachment 5.   
 4.3.4.2.  
Proposal Attachment s: 
 
Proposal Attachment instructions will be provided in each Appendi x released under this 
solicitation.   
 
4.3.5  Additional Cost Proposal/ Budget Guidelines : 
 
Durin g the evaluation of proposals submitted under this solicitation , NASA will show all 
of the proposal data, including  cost data , to peer reviewers.  Peer reviewers may be 
from within or outside  the Government but will be required to certify that they have no 
financial interest in the outcome of the review.  Offerors  should include all relevant 
details in this Cost Proposal section and should not upload a separate budget 
document.  The Cost Proposal section does not count against the proposal page limit but it should be of a reasonable length.  
 Proposals with NASA civil servant team members :
 Proposals that include NASA civil 
servant team members must include civil servant fully burdened labor cos ts (and will be 
evaluated with civil servant labor costs ) in its detailed cost breakdown.  O fferors  are 
required to enter the NASA civil servant team member names  and fraction of full -time 
equivalent (FTE) involvement .  The funds requested for each NASA ci vil servant team 
member should include salary, fringe, materials, travel, etc. and include a Total 
Requested Funds for the NASA civil servant  team members . This budget entry should 
be made for each NASA civil servant involve d, and is in addition to the agency 
identification on the Proposal Cover Page under the Team Member Information  (Section 
18 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
VI) and the NASA civil servant FTE designation under the NASA Civil Servant Project 
Personnel information (Section VIII) .  NOTE: Proposal budgets from NASA Centers 
must include all costs that will be paid out of resulting awards.  
 
Since NASA funding sent to NASA Centers must be obligated in the same fiscal year (FY) in which they are received, proposals submitted by NASA Centers ( except  JPL) 
should begin the budget section of the proposal with a breakdown of funding by NASA Center and by fiscal year.  
 Principal  Investigators  from JPL
 should not include the JPL fixed  fee in the total 
requested amount, nor should the budgets of JPL Co- Investigators on proposals from 
other institutions include the JPL fixed  fee in their total requested amount. The total 
requested amount is the amount that shows on the NSPIRES online (cover page) budget form or the Grants.gov standard budget form.  JPL fixed  fees are paid for and 
accounted for by a different mechanism than the mechanism used to fund research projects.  JPL proposers and Co- Investigators may include the fixed  fee for 
informational purposes in their budget narratives and detailed budgets.  
 Non-NASA U.S. Government organizations
 proposing as team members should 
propose based on full -cost accounting unless no such standards are in effect; in that 
case such offerors  should follow the Managerial Cost Accounting Standards for the 
Federal Governme nt, as recommended by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory 
Board (for further information, see http://www.hq.nasa.gov/fullcost ).  Proposal budgets 
must include all costs that will be paid through  the res ulting award.  
 Allowable costs for contract awards are covered in Part 31 of the FAR, located 
at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/index.html
 and part 1831 of the NASA FAR 
Supplement (NFS), located at 
http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/nfstoc.htm . Pre -contract costs are 
covered in FAR 31.109, and NFS 1852.231- 70. 
 Certified Cost or Pricing Data:  Certificate of Curr ent Cost or Pricing Data (FAR 15.406-
2) will be required after negotiations and before award of a contract when the cost 
proposal exceeds $700,000.   The requirements for certified cost or pricing data will be 
in accordance with FAR 15.403- 4.    
 Allowable costs for grant and cooperative agreement awards with universities, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations and awards with commercial firms that do not involve cost-sharing are covered in 2 CFR 200 Subpart E –  COST PRINCIPLES.  Pre -award 
costs are covered in 2 CFR 200.209 and 2 CFR 1800.209.   
 Allowable costs for grant and cooperative agreement awards with commercial firms involving cost sharing are covered in 14 CFR 1274.204. Pre- award costs are covered in 
FAR 31.109 and NFS 1831.205- 32 
  
19 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
 
4.3.6  Proposal  Funding Restrictions  
 In addition to the funding restrictions and requirements given in the NASA Guidebook for Proposers, 2 CFR 200, 2 CFR 1 800, 14 CFR 1274 and the GCAM, the following 
restrictions are applicable to this solicitation:  
 
• The estim ated funding and number of proposals anticipated to be funded are 
subject to the availability  of appropriated funds, as well as the submission of a 
sufficient number of proposals of adequate merit.  
 
• It is not anticipated that this solicitation will require the construction of facilities 
(i.e., buildings, structures, or other real property).  However, if new or modified facilities are required to further the technology, the offerors shall clearly state the rationale.  For further information on allowable cos ts, refer to the cost principles 
cited 2 CFR 200 Subpart E –  COST PRINCIPLES or FAR Part 31 and NFS Part 
1831 depending on whether a grant/cooperative agreement or contract will be the resulting award instrument.  
 
• U.S. award recipients may directly purchas e supplies and/or services that do not 
constitute research from non- U.S. sources, but award funds may not be used to 
fund research carried out by non- U.S. organizations. However, subject to export 
control restrictions, a foreign national may receive remuneration through a NASA award for the conduct of research while employed either full or part time by a 
U.S. organization (see Section 1.6 of the NASA Guidebook for Proposers ).  
 
• Typically travel, including foreign travel, is allowed as may be necessary for t he 
meaningful completion of the proposed investigation, as well as for publicizing its  
results at appropriate professional meetings.  
 
• Profit for commercial firm s is not allowable under grant or cooperative agreement 
awards but is allowable under contract awards.  
 
4.3.7  International Space Station (ISS) Research, Development, Demonstration 
Opportunities  
 
The ISS provides proposers with a national laboratory resource with unique environments for the development of space technologies.  
  
Although ISS utilization is not required, if the offeror proposes to use ISS, the following guidance is provided.     
  
The ISS program provides transportation to the ISS and standard experiment integration activities free of charge to approved, sponsored t echnology development 
investigations.   For submissions proposing to utilize the ISS or its commercial launch 
assets please contact the ISS Research Integration Office to obtain a letter of feasibility.

4.4   Proposal Submission Dates, Time, and Location  
 For each opportunity described in the A ppendices to this solicitation , the electronic 
proposal must be submitted in its entirety by an AOR, no later than 5 :00 p.m. Eastern 
Time  on the appropriate proposal due date given in the respective A ppendix. During the 
final hours before the submission deadline, offerors may experience server/connection congestion.  Therefore , offerors are urged to familiarize themselves with the submission  
system(s), ensure they are registered in NSPIRES (even if offerors  are submitting 
through Grants.gov), and begin the submission process early . Offerors are strongly 
encouraged to submit proposals at least 48 hours in advance of submission deadline.     
 Proposals submitted after the proposal deadline on the proposal due date will be 
considered late and may be rejected without review .  Late proposals will be handled in 
accordance with NASA’s policy given in section (g) of NFS clause 1852.235- 72 
“Instructions  for Responding to NRAs” . Offerors  should also keep in mind that the 
NSPIRES Help Desk is not staffed after 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time and the Grants.gov customer support contact center is not staffed after 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  
 
4.5   Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information  
 Except as provided below, information contained in proposals is used for evaluation purposes only  and will be protected to the extent permitted by law.  In order to maximize 
protection of trade secrets or other information that are confi dential or privileged, 
proposers should identify such information in their proposals . 
 For selected proposals, NASA requires  the Proposal Title, the Principal Investigator's 
name and organization, the Proposal Summary and the one- page summary /overview  
chart to be publishable  and submission of a proposal constitutes consent to publication 
of that information on an appropriate publicly accessible location.  Offeror s should draft 
their Proposal Summaries and one- page summary /overview  charts in anticipation of 
public disclosure.  Offerors  are free, but not required by NASA, to release any additional 
information about their proposals .  NASA considers other sections of proposals to be 
proprietary and, therefore, does not release these sections o f successful proposals to 
the public without prior consultation with the offerors . 
  
21 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
4.6 Conflict of Interest Check Information  
 
The integrity of the peer review process is of utmost importance to STMD.  The peer review process will be conducted in accordance with STMD’s Organizational Conflict of 
Interest (OCI) Mitigation Plan  and Appendix C.4 of the NAS A Guidebook for Proposers.   
In order to ensure that all proposal evaluations are conducted as fairly and equitabl y as 
possible, it is important to ascertain whether prospective reviewers may have conflicts 
of interest that might affect their impartiality.   
 To facilitate the process of identifying potential conflicts of interest, it is necessary to collect information about the organizations participating in each proposal.  Information provided in the NSPIRES Cover Sheet will be used to collect this information.  Offerors 
using Grants.gov should ensure that all information requested in the Grants.Gov 
response structure is provided.  Failure to submit the required information m ay result in 
the proposal being deemed nonresponsive to the solicitation.   
 
5.0 PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION  
 
5.1 Compliance Review  
 NASA will prescreen all proposals for compliance with  requirements  of this solicitation  
and its subsequent Appendices.   This includes:  
• Submission of a complete proposal with all required elements . 
• Submission of a proposal from an eligible offeror  as specified in the Eligibility 
Information  in this solicitation and relevant Appendix . 
• Submission of a budget that includes details of any subawards and that is for a 
funding period consistent with this NR A. 
• Submission of a proposal that is consistent with the page limitations and 
formatting guidelines  specified in this NRA.  
 Non-compliant proposals will not be further considered.  
 
5.2 Evaluation Criteria  
 
The e valuation criteria described in Section C.2 of the NASA Guidebook for Proposers  
are superseded by the evaluation criteria described below:  
 
• Relevance to NASA ’s Objectives  
• Technical Approach  
• Management Approach  
• Cost 
 
The Appendices will provide additional  information regarding the evaluation 
criteria and may contain additional or tailored evaluation criteria . The relative 
weight ings for each evaluation criterion will also be provided in the Appendices.  If any 
22 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
criteria in the Appendices conflict with any other part of this umbrella solicitation, the 
criteria identified in the Appendices will take precedence.  
 Offerors  are cautioned that their proposals will be  evaluated based upon the contents of 
their proposal, which must be responsive to the requirements  for proposal submission 
set forth in S ection 4 above  and in the relevant A ppendix .   
 A panel of subject matter experts (SME) will be used to assess each proposal against 
the evaluation criteria.  This panel of experts may include non- NASA and other non-
Government personnel.  The SMEs  may also express opinions on the perceived 
programmatic relevancy and cost reasonableness of a proposal  in light of its technical 
content.    Evaluation of the proposed cost may also include the realism and reasonableness of the 
proposed cost and comparison to available funds.  Offerors  must follow the budget 
format requirements provided in Section  2.3.10 of the NASA Guidebook for Proposers  
and additional budget format  requirements provided in the relevant Appendix .  
 The selection official may take portfolio balance and other program related factors  into 
account when selecting proposals for funding.   Cost -sharing is generally not considered 
a part of the evaluation.  However, funding c ontribution may become a factor at the time 
of selection when deciding between proposals of otherwise equal technical merit.  
 
5.3 Review and Selection Processes  
 
Review of proposals submitted in response to this solicitation will be consistent with the 
general policies and provisions described in Appendix C.1, C.3, and C.4 of the NASA Guidebook for Proposers.  Unless otherwise specified in the relevant Appendix, selection procedures will be consistent with the procedures identified in Appendix C.5 of the NASA Guidebook for Proposers. Unless otherwise specified in the relevant 
Appendix, the STMD Associate Administrator will be the Selection Official. The Selection Official may take portfolio balance and other programmatic considerations into account when m aking final selections.  
 
5.4 Partial Awards and Participation with Others  
 NASA may elect to offer selection of only a portion of a proposed project , usually at a 
level of support reduced from that requested in the original proposal or may also offer tentativ e selections in which NASA requests offerors  to team in a joint project.  
Additionally, NASA may decide to award an effort for less than the full period of the proposal .  Offeror s will be given the opportunity to accept or decline such selection. If 
the offeror accepts such an offer, a revised budget and statement of work may be 
required before funding action on the proposal can be initiated.  If the offeror  declines 
the offer of a partial selection, or participation in a joint project , NASA may withdraw the 
offer of selection in its entirety.   
23 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
5.5 Selection Announcement and Award Dates  
 
NASA’s goal is to announce selections as soon as possible.  However, NASA does not usually announce new selections until the funds needed for those awards are approved through the Federal budget process.  Therefore, a delay in the budget process for 
NASA usually results in a delay of the selection date . By submitting a proposal, the 
offeror acknowledges that the proposal is valid for no less than 6 months from 
submission.   
 In order to announce selection decisions as soon as is practical, even in the presence of 
budget uncertainties, the Selection Official may decide to defer selection decisions on some proposals while making selection decisions on others. If a Selection Offici al uses 
this option, then proposals will be categorized as selected, not selected, or “not selected 
at this time.”  Proposals that are “ not selected at this time”  may be considered for a 
supplemental selection when circumstances allow. All offerors  whose proposals are “ not 
selected at this time”  will eventually be notified whether their proposal is selected 
through a supplemental selection or is no longer being considered for a supplemental selection.  
 All offerors  will be notified via electronic mail sent by  NSPIRES and offered a debriefing 
that is consistent with the policy in Appendix C.5.3 and C.6 of the NASA Guidebook for 
Proposers  and in formation in the relevant A ppendix , if applicable .

SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
Attachment 3 -  Submission of Proposals via NSPIRES  
 
Proposals may be submitted electronically via NASA’s master proposal data base system, the NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES).  In order to submit a proposal via NSPIRES, this solicitation requires that the offeror  register key data concerning the intended submission with NSPIRES  
at http://nspires.nasaprs.com
.  Potential applicants are urged to access this site well in 
advance of the NOI and proposal due date(s) of interest to familiarize themselves with its structure and enter the requested identifier information.  
 It is especially important to note that every individual named on the proposal’s electronic 
Cover Page form (see below) as a proposing team member in any role, including co-
investigators and collaborators, must be individually registered in NSPIRES and that 
such indi viduals must perform this registration themselves; no one may register a 
second party, even the PI  of a proposal in which that person is committed to participate. 
It is also important to note that every named individual must be identified with the 
organization through which they are participating in the proposal, regardless of their place of permanent employment or preferred mailing address.  This data site is secure 
and all information entered is for NASA’s use only.   Offerors  are reminded that peer 
reviewers performing the evaluation of proposals may be non- Government personnel 
(see Section 4. 6 above).  
 Every individual identified on the NSPIRES proposal cover page as a team member must indicate their commitment to the proposed work through NSPIRES prior to 
proposal cover page submission.  In addition, team members must confirm the 
organization throug h which they are participating in this proposal by requesting an 
affiliation with their organization in NSPIRES.  An AOR with the organization must then login to NSPIRES and approve this affiliation request.  
 Each team member will receive an email from NSP IRES indicating that he/she has 
been added to the proposal and should log in to NSPIRES.   
 
• Once logged in, the team member should follow the link in the ""Reminders and Notifications"" section of his NSPIRES homepage, titled ""Need Co- I and/or 
Collaborator S tatement of Commitment For: Proposal to Solicitation <<solicitation 
number>>.""  On the ""Team Member Statement of Commitment -  Confirmation"" 
page, the team member should read the commitment language, click the ""Accept"" button, and then click ""OK"".  
 
• PI's may  monitor the status of team member commitments by examining the 
""Commitment Confirmed"" column on the Team Member page of the NSPIRES proposal cover page record.  
 All proposals submitted via NSPIRES in response to this solicitation and Appendices 
issued und er this solicitation must include a required electronic Cover Page form that is 
32 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
accessed at http://nspires.nasaprs.com . This form is comprised of several distinct 
sections:  
• Applicant and Proposing Organization Information that contains the identifier 
information for the proposing institution and personnel;  
• Proposal Summary  that provides an overview of the proposed project suitable for 
release through a publicly accessible archive should the proposal be selected;  
• Budget Data that provides the proposed start and end dates, as well as other 
proposal characteristics and a budget summary;  
• Program Specific Data  that includes required questions specific to this solicitation  
and Appendix; and  
• Proposal Team  that provides the co- investigators and other participants in the 
proposal.   
 
This Cover Page form is available for access and submission starting at the 
solicitation/Appendix release date and remains open until the proposal due date.   
Unless specified i n an Appendix to this solicitation , no other forms are required for 
proposal submission via NSPIRES.  See the NASA Guidebook for Proposers , Sections 
2 and 3 for further details.  
 The required elements of a  proposal submitted in response to an Appendix to this 
solicitation must be submitted as a single, searchable, unlocked PDF document that is 
attached to the Cover Page using the tools in NSPIRES.  The PDF document shall contain the complete proposal, including all components listed in the Appendix to which the offeror  is responding.  All required information and permitted attachments must be 
included in the PDF file and should not
 be uploaded as separate attachments, unless 
specified otherwise in the relevant Appendi x.  Documents such as the team member 
biographical sketches, letters of commitment, and current and pending support should not be uploaded to NSPIRES as separate files.  
 NSPIRES will provide a list of all elements that make up an electronic proposal, and after clicking the “Check Elements” button, the system will conduct an element check to identify any item(s) that is (are) apparently missing or incomplete. NSPIRES will also generate error and warning messages as part of the element check concerning p ossibly 
missing data. An error (designated by a red “ X”) will preclude proposal submission to 
NASA by the AOR. A warning (indicated by an exclamation mark “ !” on a yellow field) is 
an indication that data may be missing; a warning can be ignored after veri fying that the 
material is included in the single attachment containing the complete proposal. Any actions taken because of warnings are at the PI's discretion.  It is the offeror’s 
responsibility to ensure that the proposal is complete and includes all req uired 
components upon submission.  
 It is unnecessary to download the Proposal Cover Page and incorporate it into the Proposal Document. NSPIRES will automatically combine the two parts of the proposal 
(Cover Page form and Proposal Attachment ) for the revie wers.  
 
33 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
Offerors  are encouraged to begin their submission process early.  Tutorials and other 
NSPIRES help topics may be accessed through the NSPIRES online help site 
at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ external/help.do .  For any questions that cannot be 
resolved with the available on- line help menus, requests for assistance may be directed 
to the NSPIRES Help Desk by e -mail to nspires -help@nasaprs.com  or by  telephone to

SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
Attachment 4 -  Submission of Proposals via Grants.gov  
 
Grants.gov allows organizations to electronically find and apply for competitive grant opportunities from all Federal grant -making agencies; it provides a single access point 
for over 1000 grant programs offered by the 26 Federal grant -making agencies.  Th e 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is the managing partner for Grants.gov.  
 In order to submit a proposal via Grants.gov, Grants.gov requires that the PI  download 
an application package from Grants.gov.  Identifying the appropriate application 
package requires the funding opportunity number which may be found on the Cover 
Page of each Appendix. Proposals submitted via Grants.gov 
must be submitted by the 
AOR .   
 
Submitting a proposal via Grants.gov requires the following steps:  
• Grant researcher s do NOT need to register with Grants.gov. However, every 
individual named in the proposal as a proposing team member in any role, including PI, co- investigators and other team members  must be registered in 
NSPIRES ( http://nspires.nasaprs.com
) and those individuals must perform this 
registration themselves; no one may register a second party, even the PI of a proposal in which that person is committed to participate.  This data site is secure and all information entered is strictly for NASA’s use only.  However, offerors  are 
reminded that peer reviewers performing the evaluation of proposals may be non-Government personnel (see Section 4. 6 above).  
• All team members  must be affiliated with their organizations in NSPIR ES.  Each 
proposed team member’s organization must be registered in NSPIRES.  
• Follow Grants.gov instructions provided at the website to download any software tools or applications required to submit to Grants.gov.  
• Download the application package from Grants.gov by selecting “Download grant 
application packages” under “Apply for Grants” at http://www.grants.gov
.  Each 
program element described in an Appendix to this solicitation requires a different 
application package and has a different Funding Opportunity Number; the 
Funding Opportunity Number may be found on the Cover Page of  each 
Appendix. Enter the appropriate Funding Opportunity Number (e.g. “NNH 15ZOA001N -XX”) to retrieve the desired application package. All NASA 
application packages may be found by searching on CFDA Number 43. 009. 
• Complete the required Grants.gov forms including the SF424 Application for Federal Assistance, Research and Research -Related (R&R) Other Project 
Information, R&R Senior/Key Person Profile, and R&R Budget.  Every named individual must be identified with the organization through which they are participating in the proposal, regardless of their place of permanent employment or preferred mailing address.  
• Complete the required NASA speci fic forms:  NASA Other Project Information, 
NASA Principal Investigator and Authorized Representative Supplemental Data Sheet, and NASA Senior/Key Person Supplemental Data Sheet (this form is only 
required if there are Senior/Key Persons other than the PI ).  
35 
SpaceTech- REDDI -2015  
• Complete the NASA program -specific data (PSD) form that is r equired for the 
specific Appendix .  This form is included as a PDF form within the proposal 
application package downloaded from Grants.gov  
• Create a proposal in a single PDF including the technical and management 
section and all other required proposal sections as identified in the relevant 
Appendix (also see Section 2 of the NASA Guidebook for Proposers ).  In 
addition, as prompted by grants.gov, upload sections as separate PDF  
documents.  
• Becaus e Grants.gov does not support the electronic commitment of team 
members, statements of commitment from all team members must be provided 
as letters attached to the proposal application at the place(s) specified by Grants.gov. This statement must include confirmation of both the team member role in the proposed effort (e.g., Co- Investigator, collaborator) and the 
identification of the organization through which the team member will be participating. Here is an example statement of commitment:  
o ""I acknowledge that I am identified by name as <<role>> to the 
investigation, entitled <<name of proposal>>, that is submitted by <<name of Principal Investigator>> to the NASA Research Announcement <<alpha- numeric identifier>>, and that I intend to carry out all 
responsibilities identified for me in this proposal. I understand that the extent and justification of my participation as stated in this proposal will be considered during peer review in determining in part the merits of this 
proposal. I have read the entire pr oposal, including the management plan 
and budget, and I agree that the proposal correctly describes my commitment to the proposed investigation.   For the purposes of 
conducting work for this investigation, my participating organization is <<insert name of organization>>""  
• Submit the proposal via the AOR; the proposal PI may not submit the application 
to Grants.gov unless he/she is an AOR.  
 Potential applicants are urged to access Grants.gov site well in advance of the proposal due date(s) of interest to fam iliarize themselves with its structure and download the 
appropriate application packages and tools.   Additional instructions for formatting and submitting proposals via Grants.gov may be 
found in Sections 2 and 3 of the NASA Guidebook for Proposers .  Instructions for the 
use of Grants.gov may be found in the Grants.gov User Guide at 
http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/home.html
 and searching under Site Content for User 
Guide .  Instructions for NASA -specific forms and NASA program -specific data forms 
may be found in the application package.  These NASA program -specific data forms are 
required, and failure to properly include them may result in the proposal being deemed unacceptable.  For any questions that cannot be resolved with the available on- line help 
menu s and documentation, requests for assistance may be directed by e- mail 
to support@grants.gov
 or by telephone to (800) 518- 4726, Monday through Friday, 7:00
